# generated validate yamls

The files in this directory are autogenerated. If you'd like to make your
own custom one, put it in `validate_yamls`.

Some notes:

1. Only files ending with `.generated.yaml` in this directory are used.
2. If you want to add a python package, you can add it to `python_packages.yaml`
   See the comments in that file for instructions.
