# this file holds mappings of artifact names to python import names
# for artifacts for which we want to autogenerate validate yamls
#
# The format is
#
# <conda pkg name>:
#   top_level_imports:
#     - <any top level import names go here>
#   # optional allowed section
#   # entires in this list are conda pkgs that are allowed to stomp on this
#   # python package's files
#   # if not given, the <conda pkg name> is an implicit entry
#   # if given, these are appended to a list with the <conda pkg name> in it
#   allowed:
#    - <other conda pkg>
